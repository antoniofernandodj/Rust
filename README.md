# Roadmap

## Beginner

In 2023, the main roadmap to learn Rust would likely involve the following steps:

1. Start with the basics: Learn the syntax and basic concepts of the language, such as variables, functions, data types, and control flow.

2. Learn about ownership and borrowing: Rust's unique ownership model is one of its key features, and understanding it is essential for writing safe and efficient code.

3. Learn about the standard library and its modules, such as the collections module and the I/O module.

4. Learn about common data structures and algorithms: Rust's standard library provides a wide range of data structures and algorithms, and learning about them will help you write more efficient and readable code.

5. Learn about the basics of the cargo package manager and how to use it to manage dependencies and build your projects.

6. Learn about common Rust crates and libraries: Rust has a large and active community, and there are many external libraries and crates available that can help you with specific tasks.

7. Learn about advanced features: Once you have a solid understanding of the basics, you can start to explore more advanced features of the language such as macros, generics, and concurrency.

8. Practice, Practice, Practice: as with any programming language, the best way to learn Rust is to write code. Try building small projects and experimenting with different features to solidify your understanding.

9. Finally, dive into more advanced topics such as FFI, WebAssembly, and others if you're interested in those.

Join communities: Rust has a very active community, and you can find many resources and support. Joining a Rust community is a great way to learn from others, get help with difficult problems, and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the language.
